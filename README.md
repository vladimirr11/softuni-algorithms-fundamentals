# softuni-algorithms-fundamentals
Part of this repo are some of the most common algorithmic techniques used in practice like - recursion and backtracking, combinatorial algorithms, searching, sorting and gready algorithms. Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS) and algorithms for finding of shortest path in graph are also included. Dynamic programming (DP) and solving of optimization problems using DP techniques are also included.
